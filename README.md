PSXtract2021
========

PSXtract2021 is a tool to decrypt and convert PSOne Classics from PSP/PS3.
It was originally written by **Hykem**, and has been modified by **Mr-Berzerk**
to be compatible with Windows 10 x64, and add support for additional PSX pbp roms.
EG. Wing Commander IV.

This tool allows you to decrypt a PSOne Classics EBOOT.PBP on your PC, using
the emulated PSP method.
It features a modified version of libkirk's source code to support DES
encryption/decryption and the AMCTRL functions.


Notes
-------

Using the "-c" option in the command line, psxtract will additionally
convert the resulting ISO image to a mountable PSOne CD-ROM binary image (BIN/CUE).

You may supply a KEYS.BIN file to the tool, but this is not necessary.
Using the internal files' hashes, psxtract can calculate the key by itself.

Game file manual decryption is also supported (DOCUMENT.DAT).

Working games and compatibility
-------------------------------

The following games have been tested with ePSXe and are known to work. All games were bought from the PSN US store unless another store is indicated.

- Alundra (UK)
- Breath of Fire IV
- Castlevania Symphony of the Night (UK)
- Crash Bandicoot
- Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back
- Crash Bandicoot 3: WARPED
- CTR: Crash Team Racing
- Final Fantasy VII (UK,German)
- Final Fantasy VIII (US,UK)
- Final Fantasy IX (US,UK)
- Grandia
- Disney's Hercules
- Legend of Dragoon
- Legend of Mana
- Mega Man X4
- Mega Man X5
- Metal Gear Solid (German)
- Metal Slug X
- Simcity 2000
- Spyro the Dragon
- Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage
- Spyro Year of the Dragon
- Suikoden (UK)

If you have used this program on a game not listed, and it has worked, don't hesitate to let
Mr-Berzerk know, so it can be added to the verified list.

If a game does not appear on this list, that does not mean it won't work - it means it hasn't been tested yet. All tested games have worked so far. If you experience graphic issues, it will be due to the settings of your emulator. For example, in Final Fantasy IX and Breath of Fire IV, the battle intro animation will not happen or look different from the original game with default ePSXe settings. Make sure to set "Framebuffer effects" to 1 or more in the settings of Pete's graphics plugin. Enabling off-screen drawing is also worth a shot. The games from the PSN store should be full versions. For example, Crash Bandicoot 3 even includes the demo of Spyro the Dragon which is accessible through a cheat code in the main menu, just like the original game.
